# When I'm Not Here
ITP2021 : Thesis project 

People die twice, first is physical death, the second is when we were forgotten which seems impossible in this everlasting digital world where our digital selves are endlessly copied and preserved. 

**‘When I’m Not Here’** is an exploration of the second death through digital decomposition in a form of self-destruction video sculpture aiming to enhance the value of impermanence.
